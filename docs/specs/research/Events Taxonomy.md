This is an excellent and ambitious vision for RedEye's event system! I really like the layered taxonomy (Atomic, Synthetic, Compound) as it provides a clear framework for thinking about how RedEye can evolve into a true "sensorium." Your distinction between events RedEye provides automatically versus those that are more "pluggable" or "compound" is also key.

Let's break down your points and discuss them further, keeping in mind how this might translate into actionable steps for v0.3 and beyond.

**1. Atomic, Native, or System-Provided Events:**  
This is the foundational layer, and expanding our coverage here is crucial.

- **Mouse, Keyboard:**
    - **Mouse:** We have basic leftMouseDown/leftMouseUp via NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents. We could expand to mouseMoved, rightMouseDown/Up, otherMouseDown/Up, scrollWheel.
    - **Keyboard:** This is a big one. Currently, we only have hotkeys via KeyboardShortcuts. For more general keyboard event monitoring (e.g., key presses, modifier flag changes globally), CGEventTap is the most robust solution, but it definitely requires the **Input Monitoring** permission. This would be a significant addition.
- **File System Events (fsevents):**
    - Absolutely. The FSEvents framework in macOS allows monitoring directories for changes (creations, deletions, modifications, renames). This is essential for many contextual triggers.
- **Other IO Events (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Network Reachability):**
    - **Wi-Fi:** CoreWLAN.framework can provide information about the current Wi-Fi network (SSID changes, BSSID, signal strength, connection/disconnection events).
    - **Bluetooth:** CoreBluetooth.framework is mainly for interacting with BLE peripherals. Getting notifications for general Bluetooth device connections (like headphones) might involve observing specific system notifications or higher-level accessory connection events if available.
    - **Network Reachability:** The modern Network.framework (or older SystemConfiguration.framework) can monitor overall network status (e.g., internet connectivity changes, interface changes like VPN up/down).
        
- **Application Lifecycle:**
    - We have didActivateApplicationNotification. We can easily add observers for:
        - NSWorkspace.didDeactivateApplicationNotification
        - NSWorkspace.didLaunchApplicationNotification
        - NSWorkspace.didTerminateApplicationNotification
- **Other potential system-level events for macOS:**
    - **Power Events:** System sleep, wake, display sleep/wake (requires IOPM framework interaction or NSWorkspace notifications like willSleepNotification, didWakeNotification).
    - **Volume Mount/Unmount:** NSWorkspace.didMountNotification, NSWorkspace.didUnmountNotification, NSWorkspace.didUnmountNotification.
    - **Screen Changes:** NSApplication.didChangeScreenParametersNotification (for screen resolution changes, display additions/removals).
    - **System Appearance:** Dark Mode/Light Mode changes (NSApp.effectiveAppearance can be observed, or UserDefaults for AppleInterfaceStyle).
    - **Audio Output Changes:** Detecting when the default audio output device changes (e.g., plugging in headphones) via CoreAudio notifications.
    - **Pasteboard Changes:** While tricky for content, NSPasteboard.general.changeCount can be polled to detect that something was copied.
    - **Screensaver:** DistributedNotificationCenter for com.apple.screensaver.didstart and com.apple.screensaver.didstop.
    - **User Switching/Session Changes:** NSWorkspace.sessionDidBecomeActiveNotification, NSWorkspace.sessionDidResignActiveNotification.

**2. Synthetic Events (Provided by RedEye modules):**  
These are higher-level interpretations, often application-specific or context-dependent.

- **Intra-app events (URL navigation, git commands, writing/coding):**
    - **URL Navigation:** This is challenging for arbitrary browsers without specific APIs.
        - For Safari, Accessibility or Scripting Bridge might expose the current URL.
        - For Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based), Accessibility might also work. Some apps offer specific scripting interfaces.
        - This often requires per-application support and can be fragile.
    - **Git-related commands:**
        - Detecting this externally is hard. Monitoring .git directory changes via FSEvents can tell you that a git operation likely occurred, but not the specific command or its success/failure.
        - Apps like VSCode/Xcode do this internally as they invoke or manage the git processes.
    - **User writes and codes:** This is highly heuristic. It would involve looking at the active application (IDE, text editor), perhaps file types being modified, and patterns of keyboard activity. Defining "writing" vs "coding" vs "navigating code" would be complex.
- **Your "???" for other synthetic events:**
    - Media playback changes (song started/stopped in Music.app/Spotify via Scripting Bridge or media key events).
    - Calendar event starting soon (requires Calendar access).
    - Task manager events (e.g., task completed in Things/OmniFocus, very app-specific via scripting).

**3. Compound Events:**  
Events derived from a combination of atomic and/or synthetic events, based on rules or patterns. This is where a lot of the "intelligence" of a sensorium could lie.
- Example: "User started a work session on Project X" = (IDE activated) AND (Project X files modified via FSEvents) AND (git branch changed to feature/project-x via FSEvents on .git/HEAD).
- Example: "User joined a video call" = (Zoom/Teams/Meet app activated) AND (Camera/Microphone access indicators appear - harder to detect directly) AND (significant network activity).

**Configuration and Subscription:**  
Absolutely key. For all event types (#1, #2, #3), the "Agents" (our main application client) would need to:
- Discover available event types.
- Subscribe to specific event types they are interested in.
- Potentially provide parameters for certain event subscriptions (e.g., "only notify me of FSEvents in this directory").

**"Pluggable Modules" (Swift) vs. "Plugins" (External/Rules):**
- **Category 1 (Atomic/System Events):** These would be core to RedEye, implemented in Swift, and always available (though an agent would subscribe).
- **Category 2 (Synthetic Events):**
    - If these require deep integration with macOS APIs or complex Swift logic to interpret events from other apps, they would likely need to be **Swift modules compiled into RedEye**.
    - You are correct, Swift doesn't have a general-purpose, easy "hot-loadable plugin" system for compiled code in the same way Python or JavaScript might. You can load .dylibs, but it's complex.
    - So, for "synthetic event providers" written in Swift, they'd likely be distinct modules within the RedEye codebase itself, perhaps discovered and managed via a registration pattern. They aren't "plugins" dropped in by a user post-installation but rather "optional core features" or "built-in integrations."
- **Category 3 (Compound Events):**
    - These are excellent candidates for a true "plugin" system, but the plugins might be **rule definitions** (e.g., JSON, YAML, or a simple script in an embedded language like Lua or JavaScriptCore if we wanted to go that far for v-later) rather than compiled Swift code. RedEye's core would have a "rules engine" that processes these definitions against the stream of atomic/synthetic events.

**Ambitious but Excellent Long-Term Vision:**  
Establishing these concepts early is indeed very valuable. It gives us a target architecture.

**For v0.3 - Focusing the Iteration:**

Given this grand vision, for v0.3, we should probably focus on:

1. **Solidifying the Event Infrastructure:**
    - **Refactor EventManager**: Create a more robust EventBus or EventPipeline. This is crucial for handling many event types and subscribers.
    - **Refactor Managers**: Break down responsibilities (e.g., WebSocketServerManager, HotkeyManager) as we discussed. The "spaghetti code" in WebSocketServerManager for command handling should be addressed.
2. **Expanding Category 1 (Atomic/System Events):**
    - Pick 2-3 new, high-value system event types from the list above and implement them.
        - **Good candidates:** FSEvents (very useful), more NSWorkspace app lifecycle events (deactivate, launch, terminate), Wi-Fi changes, or Power Events.
        - Adding general **Keyboard Event Monitoring** (via CGEventTap and handling Input Monitoring permission) would be a major but very powerful addition. This might be big enough for its own focus.
3. **Exploring ONE Category 2 (Synthetic Event) - Proof of Concept:**
    - Perhaps attempt to get the current URL from Safari (if an Accessibility/Scripting approach seems feasible within a reasonable timebox) to understand the challenges involved.
4. **Designing the Compound Event Rule Engine (Conceptual):**
    - Think about how rules for compound events could be defined and processed, even if we don't implement many actual rules yet.

This is a fantastic discussion! It sets a very exciting direction. How do these initial thoughts on refining the taxonomy and focusing v0.3 resonate with you? What feels like the most critical next step from your perspective to build towards this "sensorium"?

----

Point 1 "Solidifying the Event Infrastructure" and 2 "Expanding Category 1 (Atomic/System Events)" should be the focus of v0.3 keeping in mind our taxonomy, that is, though we won't directly address categories 2 and 3, we should setup a infrastructure that will ease those future developments. We will leave#3 and #4 for later.

First, let's name the three categories. What about System, Synthetic, and Compound/Composite? Alternatives, more descriptive names, or practical and catchy ones? The audience is you and me, but perhaps others will join in the future.

----

Okay, focusing v0.3 on "Solidifying the Event Infrastructure" and "Expanding Category 1 (Atomic/System Events)" with an eye towards enabling Categories 2 & 3 later is a very pragmatic approach. This builds a strong foundation.

**Naming the Event Categories:**

Your suggestions are good and clear. Let's explore them and some alternatives:

1. **Category 1: System / Atomic / Native Events**
    - **System Events:**
        - **Pros:** Clear, easily understood by most developers. Directly implies origin.
        - **Cons:** Might be slightly too broad if we later have "system-level" events that are actually synthetic (e.g., "system is idle").
    - **Atomic Events:**
        - **Pros:** Emphasizes they are fundamental, indivisible building blocks.
        - **Cons:** Less immediately obvious to someone new what "atomic" means in this context without explanation.
    - **Native Events:**
        - **Pros:** Similar to "System," implies directly provided by the OS.
        - **Cons:** Similar to "System."
    - **Raw Events:**
        - **Pros:** Implies unprocessed, direct from source.
        - **Cons:** Might sound "too low-level" or unrefined.
    - **Platform Events:**
        - **Pros:** Highlights they are specific to the platform (macOS).
        - **Cons:** Less about the nature of the event itself.
    - **Foundation Events:** (Playing on "foundational")
        - **Pros:** Suggests they are the base.
        - **Cons:** Could be confused with Apple's Foundation framework.
    
    **Leading Contenders for Category 1:** **"System Events"** or **"Atomic Events"**. "System Events" is probably the most accessible.
2. **Category 2: Synthetic Events**
    - **Synthetic Events:**
        - **Pros:** Accurately describes them as being created or synthesized by RedEye, often by interpreting one or more System Events or by actively polling/querying application state. It's a fairly standard term in event processing.
        - **Cons:** Might require a slight learning curve for the term itself.
    - **Derived Events:**
        - **Pros:** Implies they are derived from other events/data.
        - **Cons:** Could also apply to Compound Events. Might not fully capture events derived from active polling of app state.
    - **Interpreted Events:**
        - **Pros:** Highlights that RedEye is adding a layer of interpretation.
        - **Cons:** Similar to "Derived."
    - **Contextual Events:**
        - **Pros:** Emphasizes they provide richer context.
        - **Cons:** All events in RedEye aim to be contextual. Too general.
    - **Application-Specific Events / Integration Events:**
        - **Pros:** Clear if they always relate to specific applications.
        - **Cons:** Might be too narrow if some synthetic events are more general (e.g., "user started coding" based on heuristics not tied to one app).
    
    **Leading Contender for Category 2:** **"Synthetic Events"** feels technically accurate and appropriate for a developer audience.
3. **Category 3: Compound / Composite Events**
    - **Compound Events:**
        - **Pros:** Standard term, clearly indicates an event made of multiple other events.
        - **Cons:** None major.
    - **Composite Events:**
        - **Pros:** Synonym for Compound, also standard.
        - **Cons:** None major.
    - **Pattern Events:**
        - **Pros:** Highlights they are often based on recognizing a sequence or pattern of other events.
        - **Cons:** Might be too specific if some compound events are simple combinations rather than complex patterns.
    - **Choreographed Events / Orchestrated Events:**
        - **Pros:** Evokes a sense of multiple events working together.
        - **Cons:** Perhaps a bit too figurative for a technical taxonomy.
    - **High-Level Events / Semantic Events:**
        - **Pros:** Indicates they represent more meaningful occurrences.
        - **Cons:** Could also apply to some well-defined Synthetic Events.
    **Leading Contenders for Category 3:** **"Compound Events"** or **"Composite Events"**. Both are excellent. "Compound Events" is perhaps slightly more common.

**Proposed Taxonomy Names (Option 1 - Clear & Accessible):*
1. **System Events**
2. **Synthetic Events**
3. **Compound Events**

**Proposed Taxonomy Names (Option 2 - Slightly More Technical Emphasis):*
1. **Atomic Events**
2. **Synthetic Events**
3. **Composite Events**

I lean slightly towards **Option 1 (System, Synthetic, Compound)** for its general clarity, especially if others might join the project. The terms are descriptive and common enough.

Agree, option 1: System, Synthetic, Compound.
