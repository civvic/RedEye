## Prompt:
Have we chat previously about the Mac app PopClip?

## Response:
No, you haven't mentioned PopClip in any previous conversation.

Are you considering using or extending PopClip for something specific?

## Prompt:
No, I'm considering developing an app with a similar UI, but different functinality. That is, the user select text in any application and my menu bar captures that selection automatically and performs actions. And maybe not just test selection, other user gestures could triggers actins as well.

## Response:
That's a great idea — developing a PopClip-style macOS menu bar app opens up some powerful interaction patterns. For capturing system-wide text selections or gestures, you'll likely need to work with the macOS Accessibility API and possibly Input Monitoring permissions.

Would you like to break this down into small components, like: (1) capturing selected text, (2) triggering from gestures or selections, and (3) showing a floating UI?

## Prompt:
yes, those components and also the menu bar app own UI.

No coding just yet., high level design.

## Response:
Perfect — here’s a high-level breakdown of the core components for your macOS menu bar app, modeled loosely after PopClip but with your own functionality.

* * *

### 1\. **Menu Bar Host App**

This is the always-running macOS app that lives in the menu bar.

**Responsibilities:**

*   Launch on login (optional).
    
*   Provide preferences window, logs/debug, plugin management, etc.
    
*   Expose enable/disable toggle for the gesture/text trigger system.
    
*   Allow configuration of actions or workflows triggered by input.
    

**Tech considerations:**

*   Built in Swift/SwiftUI (recommended), or Objective-C/Cocoa if needed.
    
*   Use `NSStatusItem` to create the menu bar item.
    

* * *

### 2\. **Input Monitoring & Gesture Detection Layer**

Responsible for detecting when the user performs a supported gesture or selects text.

**Triggers to consider:**

*   Text selection (primary)
    
*   Mouse gestures or drag events
    
*   Keyboard shortcuts
    
*   Clipboard updates
    

**Tech considerations:**

*   **Text selection:** Use the macOS Accessibility API (`AXUIElement`) to get the selected text from the active app.
    
*   **Gestures/Mouse:** Use `CGEventTap` or `NSEvent` to monitor low-level mouse events.
    
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Use `NSEvent` and/or `MASShortcut` or a similar library.
    
*   **Clipboard:** Use a timer or event-based approach to watch for clipboard changes (`NSPasteboard`).
    

**Permissions:**

*   App will require `Accessibility` and maybe `Input Monitoring` permissions in `System Settings > Privacy`.
    

* * *

### 3\. **Action System**

This layer defines what to do when a trigger is detected.

**Could support:**

*   Predefined actions (e.g., search, transform, speak).
    
*   Scripting (user-defined shell/Python/AppleScript plugins).
    
*   AI-powered tools (e.g. send to ChatGPT API).
    
*   Integrations (e.g., calendar, file, email).
    

**Architecture:**

*   Modular plugin system: Actions as dynamically loaded bundles or scripts.
    
*   Context-aware: Customize available actions depending on app, content, or gesture type.
    

* * *

### 4\. **Popup UI / Floating Panel**

This is your custom UI that shows up near the selection (like PopClip) to let the user choose an action.

**Behavior:**

*   Appears contextually, near mouse or selected text.
    
*   Can be persistent (until dismissed) or auto-dismiss after action.
    
*   Should feel native and non-intrusive.
    

**Tech considerations:**

*   Use `NSPanel` or a frameless `NSWindow`.
    
*   Use SwiftUI or AppKit for the UI.
    
*   Position near the selection using screen coordinates and `AXUIElement` position info.
    

* * *

### 5\. **System Integration & UX Enhancements**

Extra polish features to consider:

*   Detect current app and adjust behavior per-app.
    
*   Per-app/action whitelists or blacklists.
    
*   Auto-update system.
    
*   iCloud sync of user settings.
    
*   Logging and diagnostics.
    

* * *

Would you like to focus next on how the gesture/input layer interacts with the floating panel, or on designing the modular plugin/action architecture?

## Prompt:
The plugin action/action architecture. Like PopClip, my app (let's call it provisionally RedEye) implement every action as a plugin. There're several built-in actions but the user can install additional action.

Let's check first PopClip plugin system, just an overview.

## Response:
PopClip's plugin architecture is designed for flexibility and ease of use, allowing users to extend its functionality through custom extensions. Here's an overview of how it works:

* * *

### PopClip Extension Architecture

**Extension Formats:**

*   **Snippets:** Plain text in YAML format, easily shareable and installable directly from text selections.
    
*   **Packages:** Folders with a `.popclipext` extension containing a configuration file and optional resources like icons or scripts.[popclip.app+1popclip.app+1](https://www.popclip.app/dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[popclip.app+2popclip.app+2popclip.app+2](https://www.popclip.app/dev/packages?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Action Types:**

Extensions can define actions of various types, including:

*   **URL Actions:** Open a URL with the selected text inserted.
    
*   **Key Press Actions:** Simulate key presses.
    
*   **Service Actions:** Invoke macOS Services.
    
*   **Shortcut Actions:** Trigger macOS Shortcuts.
    
*   **Shell Script Actions:** Execute shell scripts.
    
*   **AppleScript Actions:** Run AppleScript code.
    
*   **JavaScript Actions:** Execute JavaScript or TypeScript code.[popclip.app+2popclip.app+2popclip.app+2](https://www.popclip.app/dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Filtering Mechanisms:**

Extensions can specify conditions under which actions appear, such as:

*   Matching specific applications.
    
*   Regular expressions against selected text.
    
*   Availability of certain services like cut, paste, or formatting.
    
*   Detection of URLs, email addresses, or file paths in the selected text.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1dh58p7/popclip_is_a_must_have_in_my_productivity_stack/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[popclip.app](https://www.popclip.app/dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Module-Based Extensions:**

For advanced functionality, PopClip supports module-based extensions using JavaScript or TypeScript. These modules can dynamically generate actions and utilize the full power of the JavaScript environment provided by PopClip.[popclip.app+2popclip.app+2popclip.app+2](https://www.popclip.app/dev/js-modules?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [PopClip Extensions Developer Reference](https://www.popclip.app/dev/).[popclip.app+6popclip.app+6popclip.app+6](https://www.popclip.app/dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Would you like to explore how to adapt this architecture for your RedEye app?

## Prompt:
PopClip uses Javascript/TypeScript for advanced functionality. I know that PopClip leverages Apple's JavaScriptCore. What other alternatives to consider like Python?

## Response:
You're right — PopClip uses Apple’s [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) to run JavaScript/TypeScript in a secure sandboxed environment. If you're designing RedEye with plugin extensibility in mind, especially to allow non-developers or power users to write and share plugins, you have several viable options beyond JavaScript.

Here’s a comparison of **alternatives to JavaScriptCore**, including **Python**:

* * *

### 🔹 1. **JavaScriptCore (JS)**

Already used by PopClip and macOS-native.

**Pros:**

*   Native on macOS (no dependencies).
    
*   Secure, embeddable, fast.
    
*   Sandboxed execution.
    
*   Strong tooling (TS support, error reporting, etc).
    

**Cons:**

*   JavaScript isn’t everyone's favorite.
    
*   Limited access to macOS APIs (unless explicitly bridged).
    

* * *

### 🔹 2. **Python (via embedded interpreter)**

You can embed Python (e.g., CPython or Pyodide) in your app.

**Pros:**

*   Very popular for scripting.
    
*   Great standard library and third-party ecosystem.
    
*   Users can write more powerful, expressive scripts.
    
*   Easy interop with shell/CLI tools.
    

**Cons:**

*   Requires bundling a Python interpreter.
    
*   Security: harder to sandbox safely.
    
*   Slower startup, heavier than JSCore.
    
*   Plugin authoring becomes more error-prone without strict interface/contracts.
    

**Tools:**

*   PyObjC to interface with macOS.
    
*   [PythonKit](https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit) if using Swift to bridge to Python.
    
*   Optionally, sandbox using subprocess + communication over pipe/socket.
    

* * *

### 🔹 3. **AppleScript / Automator / Shortcuts**

Also supported by PopClip; well-integrated with macOS.

**Pros:**

*   Native automation support.
    
*   Built-in app integration (Finder, Safari, Mail, etc).
    
*   User-friendly for certain workflows.
    

**Cons:**

*   Awkward syntax, limited community.
    
*   Not suitable for complex logic.
    

* * *

### 🔹 4. **Shell Scripts / Command Line Plugins**

Execute bash/zsh scripts from plugins.

**Pros:**

*   Easy to prototype.
    
*   Leverages macOS shell environment.
    
*   Users can write quick actions with standard tools (`awk`, `sed`, etc).
    

**Cons:**

*   Security and escaping risks.
    
*   Poor error handling.
    
*   Not portable or maintainable for complex plugins.
    

* * *

### 🔹 5. **WebAssembly (WASM)**

Sandboxed and secure, can run multiple languages compiled to WASM.

**Pros:**

*   Safe sandboxing model.
    
*   Support for many languages (Rust, Go, C, etc).
    
*   Could allow cross-platform plugin code.
    

**Cons:**

*   Heavy lift to integrate.
    
*   No direct access to macOS APIs unless bridged.
    
*   Debugging and authoring overhead.
    

* * *

### 🔹 Summary Recommendation for RedEye

| Language | Sandboxability | Ease for Users | Power | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **JavaScript (JSCore)** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Medium | ✅ Good | Best default |
| **Python** | ⚠️ Needs care | ✅ High | ✅ Excellent | Ideal for power users or CLI-heavy plugins |
| **AppleScript** | ✅ Built-in | ✅ High | ⚠️ Limited | Good for app automation |
| **Shell Scripts** | ⚠️ Minimal | ✅ High | ⚠️ Fragile | Quick hacks, but limited safety |
| **WASM** | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Low | ✅ High | Future-proof but complex |

* * *

Would you like to design RedEye's plugin manifest format next, or discuss how to sandbox Python plugin execution securely?

## Prompt:
The plugin system is more for my convenience than to allow end users to develop plugins, that i don't consider initially. I want a very basic core written in Swift to handle UI/UX and then the plugin system to handle the actions. Ideally, the core is compiled and installed once and each action is developed and plugged separately allowing me to debug it without recompiling the core.

## Response:
Perfect — that greatly simplifies your design goals and focuses your architecture toward **modular, pluggable development** with **dynamic loading**, rather than a safe scripting sandbox for end users. Here’s a revised high-level design tailored to your updated goals:

* * *

🧱 RedEye Plugin System (Developer-Facing Only)
-----------------------------------------------

### 🔹 Core Principles

*   **Small Swift-based host app:** Handles UI/UX, system triggers, plugin discovery.
    
*   **Plugins = modular, external components** (scripts, binaries, bundles).
    
*   **Hot-swappable:** Add/update/debug plugins independently of the host app.
    
*   **Debuggable in isolation:** Each action can be tested from the command line or in a REPL.
    

* * *

### 🔹 Plugin Architecture Options

#### ✅ 1. **Executable Plugins (Recommended)**

Each action is a standalone script or binary. Host app invokes them with a known input/output protocol.

**Plugin format:**

*   Plain executable file (`.sh`, `.py`, `.js`, or compiled binary).
    
*   Placed in a known directory (e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/RedEye/Plugins/`).
    
*   Named or declared via metadata (e.g., `.json` or YAML manifest).
    

**Execution model:**

*   Input: selection or gesture passed via `stdin` or CLI args (e.g., JSON).
    
*   Output: action result or menu label returned via `stdout`.
    

**Pros:**

*   Super simple to build and debug.
    
*   No need to recompile the host.
    
*   Language-agnostic (write plugins in Python, Rust, JS, Swift...).
    
*   Easily unit-tested.
    

**Cons:**

*   No direct UI interop unless designed (e.g., via stdout or external window triggers).
    
*   Cold-start time for interpreted languages (Python, Node) if many small actions.
    

* * *

#### 🧩 2. **Dynamic Libraries (e.g., `.dylib`, Swift modules)**

Each plugin is a shared library loaded dynamically via `dlopen`/`NSBundle`.

**Pros:**

*   Fast, in-process execution.
    
*   Tightly integrated with Swift host.
    
*   Enables richer UI interactions.
    

**Cons:**

*   Must be compiled with specific ABI compatibility.
    
*   More brittle during development/debug.
    
*   Unsafe if plugins crash the process.
    

⚠️ Use this for performance-critical or interactive plugins only.

* * *

#### 🔧 3. **Inter-process (Daemon or Socket-based) Plugins**

Advanced: plugins run as separate processes and communicate with the core via IPC (e.g., Unix sockets or `XPC`).

**Best when:**

*   Plugin state is long-lived.
    
*   You want crash isolation or sandboxing.
    
*   High responsiveness is important.
    

* * *

### 🔹 Manifest Format

Each plugin might ship with a lightweight manifest (e.g., `plugin.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "uppercase",
  "name": "Uppercase Text",
  "exec": "./uppercase.py",
  "filter": "text",
  "icon": "uppercase.png"
}
```

*   `exec`: relative path to the executable/script
    
*   `filter`: optionally define what types of input this applies to (text, url, etc)
    
*   `icon`: optional icon for the popup UI
    

* * *

### 🔹 Plugin Dev Workflow (Python example)

```bash
# plugin/uppercase.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
text = sys.stdin.read()
print(text.upper())
```

```bash
chmod +x plugin/uppercase.py
```

Run it in isolation:

```bash
echo "hello world" | plugin/uppercase.py
```

* * *

### 🔹 Swift Host Responsibilities

*   Scan plugin folder on startup.
    
*   For each plugin:
    
    *   Parse manifest
        
    *   Show in popup UI if matching context
        
    *   On click: spawn plugin process, pass input, capture output
        
*   Display result, optionally reinject into UI or clipboard
    

* * *

Would you like to sketch a Swift `PluginManager` responsible for discovering and invoking these plugin executables next?

## Prompt:
Later. Let's consider first the event monitoring and capturing.

Two scenarios, one basic, one advanced:
1. In any mac app, the user select text (with several gestures with mouse, trackpad or keyboard, double/triple clicks, long press, keyboard shortcuts).
2. RedEye is able to detect when the user approaches the computer using the microphone and/or camera, or even Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and greet him with a salute.

What is the support for this kind of actions currently?

## Response:
Great — these two scenarios fall into distinct layers of macOS input and context-awareness capabilities. Here's an assessment of what's possible, what’s officially supported, and what might be hacky or need workarounds.

* * *

✅ **Scenario 1: Detecting and Acting on Text Selection in Any App**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the core PopClip-like behavior and is **well-supported** through macOS APIs.

### 🧩 Tools & APIs

#### 🔹 Accessibility API (AXUIElement)

*   Used to query the UI tree of any application.
    
*   Can detect the **currently focused UI element**, and get its **selected text**.
    
*   You can poll or listen for focus/selection changes.
    

**Requirements:**

*   RedEye must request **Accessibility permissions** from the user (`TCC.db` under Privacy > Accessibility).
    

#### 🔹 Event Taps (CGEventTap)

*   Allows RedEye to monitor **low-level mouse and keyboard events**, e.g. `left click`, `drag`, `key down`, `double click`, etc.
    
*   Can be used to detect gesture patterns (like trackpad selection or keyboard shortcuts).
    

**Note:** Requires **Input Monitoring permission** for some key events.

#### 🔹 NSPasteboard Monitoring

*   A lightweight way to detect when text gets copied (⌘C), which often correlates with selection.
    
*   Can be a fallback/low-power detection path.
    

* * *

### ⚠️ Challenges

*   **Selection detection is not automatic.** You must:
    
    *   Listen for focus/gesture events (via `CGEventTap`).
        
    *   Use `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue` to inspect the focused element's selected text.
        
    *   De-bounce or rate-limit polling to avoid performance issues.
        
*   **Text selection gesture diversity:** Double-clicks, drags, keyboard, trackpad — all look similar at the system level. You'll detect gesture endpoints (e.g., mouseUp or selection change), not the precise gesture.
    

* * *

### ✔️ Verdict: **Totally feasible, with limitations**

> It’s what PopClip and similar tools use. You’ll need careful integration of `CGEventTap` and `AXUIElement` polling.

* * *

🚧 **Scenario 2: Detecting User Presence (Approach/Leave) Using Mic, Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is much more advanced and either **not officially supported** or only partially possible without private APIs or custom hardware.

* * *

### 🧩 Available Signals (with caveats)

#### 🔹 1. **Camera (Face Detection or Brightness Change)**

*   No public API to _passively_ detect face presence.
    
*   Using AVFoundation, you can start the camera feed and run face detection (e.g., via `Vision` framework).
    
*   Major **privacy implications**: requires camera access, always-on capture.
    

**Status:** Possible but intrusive and energy-costly.

* * *

#### 🔹 2. **Microphone (Sound Level, Voice Activity)**

*   You can access audio input levels via `AVAudioEngine` or `AudioQueue`.
    
*   You could detect _volume spikes_ or _voice presence_, but it’s primitive.
    
*   Always-on mic monitoring raises **privacy and App Store issues**.
    

**Status:** Technically feasible, but ethically and practically limited.

* * *

#### 🔹 3. **Bluetooth Proximity**

*   Use CoreBluetooth or IOBluetooth to scan for nearby devices (e.g., user’s iPhone or Apple Watch).
    
*   RSSI (signal strength) can infer distance.
    
*   Paired with Handoff or Continuity features, presence can be inferred when a known device is nearby.
    

**Status:** Feasible for known/personal devices.

* * *

#### 🔹 4. **Wi-Fi Proximity**

*   Can’t reliably detect physical proximity unless you control the Wi-Fi router or use special location services.
    
*   Nearby devices’ MAC addresses are randomized in modern macOS/iOS for privacy.
    

**Status:** Not feasible for this purpose.

* * *

#### 🔹 5. **macOS Presence Signals (e.g. Wake From Sleep, Unlock)**

*   Use system notifications:
    
    *   `NSWorkspace.sessionDidBecomeActiveNotification`
        
    *   `NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification`
        
    *   Check when screen unlocks (via `loginwindow` hooks or security logs)
        

**Status:** Safe and effective proxy for "user just returned"

* * *

### ✔️ Verdict: **Partially feasible with system signals and paired-device Bluetooth.**

You can't yet build a reliable, passive system like radar-based presence detection (e.g., Google's Soli or Apple's U1) using only public macOS APIs.

* * *

### 🔚 Summary

| Capability | Feasible? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detect selected text | ✅ Yes | AXUIElement + event taps |
| Detect gestures (click, drag, etc.) | ✅ Yes | CGEventTap, but gesture type must be inferred |
| Detect presence via camera | ⚠️ Hacky | Requires live capture and face detection |
| Detect presence via mic | ⚠️ Hacky | Detect sound, but primitive and noisy |
| Detect via Bluetooth device | ✅ Good | RSSI proximity for paired devices |
| Detect via Wi-Fi | ❌ No | No public support |
| System-level presence (wake, unlock) | ✅ Yes | Use `NSWorkspace` and other notifications |

* * *

Would you like to dive into how to implement presence detection using Bluetooth or `NSWorkspace` notifications next?

## Prompt:
Not yet, high level overview first.

RedEye will be open source, free, not comercial, and although ideally would be installed with the App Store, I'm open to local installation, no need at all to pass the app store review (that is changing rapidly anyway).

Also, are you aware of other apps/libraries, OSS or comercial. with similar functionality, besides PopClip? Be comprehensive, please.

* * *

If your goal is to explore or borrow implementation ideas or plugins, **Hammerspoon** and **Espanso** are the top open source projects to dig into. Would you like a deeper look into how either of them handles input monitoring or plugin loading?

## Prompt:
No need, I get an idea, thank you.

Alright, let's see a first version of a PRD for RedEye core with a first very basic plugin chat to send text selection to OpenAI models or other providers. The plugin will be written in Javascript/TypeScript (but maybe other scripting systems like Python in the future).

## Response:
Here’s a first version of a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for **RedEye**, focused on the core app and a basic initial plugin (`chat`) for sending text selections to OpenAI or similar APIs.

* * *

📝 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
--------------------------------------

### 🚀 Project Name: RedEye

### 🧭 Purpose

RedEye is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that allows users to select text in any application and invoke context-aware actions via a popup UI. It is modular and extensible via standalone plugins. The system is aimed at developer productivity and automation, not consumer customization.

* * *

🧩 MVP Scope
------------

### ✅ RedEye Core (v0.1)

#### Features:

1.  **Menu Bar Host App**
    
    *   Swift-based macOS app with a persistent status item.
        
    *   Minimal preferences UI with:
        
        *   Plugin folder path
            
        *   Enable/disable RedEye
            
        *   Debug console toggle
            
2.  **Selection Detection**
    
    *   Use Accessibility API to capture selected text in the frontmost app.
        
    *   Trigger detection via:
        
        *   MouseUp event (via `CGEventTap`)
            
        *   Keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧C or configurable)
            
    *   Fallback: Clipboard monitoring when copy command is used.
        
3.  **Popup UI**
    
    *   Display a floating menu anchored near mouse cursor.
        
    *   Show available plugins as buttons with optional icons.
        
    *   Dismissable via click-out or escape.
        
4.  **Plugin System**
    
    *   Plugins are self-contained executables (starting with JS via Node).
        
    *   Defined by a manifest (`plugin.json`) including:
        
        *   `id`, `name`, `description`, `exec`, `filter`, `icon`
            
    *   Host pipes selected text to `stdin`; plugin returns result via `stdout`.
        
5.  **Execution Flow**
    
    *   On user text selection and trigger:
        
        *   RedEye polls plugins matching context
            
        *   Popup shows available plugins
            
        *   On click: plugin is executed with selected text
            
        *   Output shown (e.g., as notification or popup)
            

* * *

### 🔌 Plugin: `chat` (v0.1)

#### Purpose:

Send selected text to a chat model (e.g., OpenAI, local LLM) and return a response.

#### Manifest (`plugin.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "chat",
  "name": "Ask AI",
  "description": "Send selection to OpenAI ChatGPT",
  "exec": "./chat.js",
  "filter": "text",
  "icon": "chat.png"
}
```

#### Script (`chat.js`):

*   Reads selected text from `stdin`
    
*   Sends it as a prompt to an OpenAI endpoint (requires API key)
    
*   Returns assistant reply via `stdout`
    

#### Requirements:

*   Node.js installed on system
    
*   User config file (`~/.redeye/config.json`) with API key and model
    
*   Basic error handling and token limit checks
    

* * *

⚙️ System Requirements
----------------------

### Permissions:

*   Accessibility access (for selection detection)
    
*   Input monitoring (optional, for gesture refinement)
    
*   Internet access (for API calls)
    

* * *

🧪 Testing Strategy
-------------------

*   Unit test plugin invocation with mock input.
    
*   UI test: selection triggers popup reliably.
    
*   Plugin test: `chat.js` executes and responds.
    
*   Graceful fallback if selection not accessible.
    

* * *

🧭 Future Enhancements (Not in MVP)
-----------------------------------

*   Plugin sandboxing
    
*   Python plugin support
    
*   Bluetooth presence detection
    
*   In-place text replacement
    
*   Action history & undo
    

* * *

Would you like the initial folder structure and a skeleton `chat.js` next?

## Prompt:
why do we need NodeJS, JavascriptCore is not enough?

## Response:
Excellent point — you're absolutely right to question that. If **RedEye plugins are written in JavaScript or TypeScript**, and **you're already embedding JavaScriptCore (JSC)** in the Swift core app, **you do _not_ need Node.js** — unless the plugin relies on Node-specific APIs (like `fs`, `http`, `require`, etc.).

* * *

🔍 JavaScriptCore vs Node.js
----------------------------

| Feature | JavaScriptCore | Node.js |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard JS (ES6) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| TypeScript Support | ⚠️ Compile to JS first | ✅ TS toolchains |
| File System, Networking | ❌ No built-in | ✅ Yes |
| Memory/process control | ✅ Embedded in your app | ✅ Separate process |
| External libraries (`npm`) | ❌ Not directly | ✅ Full support |
| Security/sandboxing | ✅ Easier to sandbox | ⚠️ Harder to control |

* * *

### 🧩 Implication for RedEye

If your plugins are:

*   Simple, self-contained JS functions (like: `"take input → return string"`),
    
*   Don't rely on filesystem, network, timers, async events,
    

Then **JavaScriptCore is sufficient and better**:

*   You can load plugin source dynamically (`JSContext.evaluateScript(...)`)
    
*   Fast execution (in-process)
    
*   Full control from Swift
    
*   More secure (no user-installed Node version needed)
    

* * *

### ✅ Revised Recommendation

*   Embed **JavaScriptCore** in the Swift app.
    
*   Use `.js` plugin files, loaded and executed by the host via `JSContext`.
    
*   Optionally allow `.ts` plugins compiled ahead of time.
    
*   For any plugin needing network access (e.g., `chat`), expose a minimal API to JS from Swift using `JSExport`.
    

* * *

### 🔧 Example (Chat Plugin in JSC)

```javascript
function run(input) {
    const apiKey = getEnv("OPENAI_API_KEY");
    const prompt = input.trim();
    return httpPost("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` },
        body: {
            model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
        }
    });
}
```

In Swift, you:

*   Bind `run()` function via `JSContext`
    
*   Inject `getEnv()` and `httpPost()` as native bridged functions
    
*   Pass `input` from selected text
    
*   Capture return value as plugin result
    

* * *

Would you like a minimal sketch of how to do that JavaScriptCore bridging in Swift?

## Prompt:
No, let's focus first in the core. IN particular the event and triggers system.

First version will be text selection, but quickly I'be augmenting that with not only text selection but full window content as text is possible but if not with a screen capture, in order to build a more powerful context for the model query.

Not for the first version, but I want to have a event capture/trigger framework in place that can accommodate that kind of future developments.

## Response:
Great — you're anticipating a general **event/trigger system** that starts with simple text selection, but will later support other input sources like window content and screen captures. Designing this modularly from the start is the right move.

Here’s a high-level design for an extensible **Trigger & Event Framework** for RedEye Core:

* * *

🧠 Conceptual Model
-------------------

```
┌────────────┐    emits     ┌──────────────┐    handled by    ┌────────────┐
│ Trigger    │ ───────────▶ │ Event Object │ ───────────────▶ │ Plugin     │
└────────────┘              └──────────────┘                  └────────────┘
```

*   **Trigger**: A module or listener that monitors for a specific user/system signal (e.g. text selection, keyboard shortcut, screen change).
    
*   **Event Object**: Standardized data structure representing what was detected.
    
*   **Plugins**: Receive events and can act on them (e.g., show UI, send API call).
    

* * *

🧩 Trigger Types (Examples)
---------------------------

| Name | Description | Source APIs | MVP? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TextSelectionTrigger` | Text selected in active window | Accessibility (AX) + CGEventTap | ✅ |
| `ClipboardTrigger` | New string copied to clipboard | NSPasteboard | ❌ |
| `WindowContentTrigger` | Full text content of focused window | AX API (AXChildren, AXValue) | ❌ |
| `ScreenCaptureTrigger` | Takes screenshot of focused window | CGWindowListCreateImage | ❌ |
| `KeyboardShortcutTrigger` | User presses configured hotkey | NSEvent + MASShortcut | ✅ |
| `MouseGestureTrigger` | Specific mouse pattern detected | CGEventTap | ❌ |
| `UserPresenceTrigger` | Detects when user returns | NSWorkspace, Bluetooth | ❌ |

* * *

🧱 `Event` Abstraction
----------------------

Define a unified event data type (e.g., `RedEyeEvent`) with a flexible schema:

```swift
struct RedEyeEvent {
    let id: UUID
    let type: EventType // .textSelection, .screenCapture, .clipboard, etc.
    let sourceApp: String
    let contextText: String? // Preferred for model input
    let imageData: NSImage? // Optional (for screenshots)
    let rawPayload: [String: Any] // Extra info
}
```

This abstraction allows downstream logic (plugin filters, UI logic, LLM pre-prompts) to operate uniformly regardless of how the data was captured.

* * *

🧩 `TriggerManager` Design
--------------------------

The core will include a `TriggerManager` which:

*   Registers triggers dynamically (modular/swappable).
    
*   Receives events from them.
    
*   Forwards events to UI and/or plugin dispatch.
    

```swift
protocol RedEyeTrigger {
    var id: String { get }
    func start()
    func stop()
    var onEvent: ((RedEyeEvent) -> Void)? { get set }
}
```

A simple text selection trigger might be implemented like this:

*   Listen for `mouseUp` or `keyboardShortcut`
    
*   Use `AXUIElement` to get selected text
    
*   Emit a `RedEyeEvent` with type `.textSelection`
    

* * *

🧭 Future-Proofing
------------------

This architecture supports:

*   **Prioritization and fusion of triggers** (e.g., combine text selection + screen content).
    
*   **Filterable event dispatch**: Plugins can declare interest in specific event types.
    
*   **Multiple simultaneous input channels**, each testable in isolation.
    

* * *

Would you like to see a concrete example of `TextSelectionTrigger` protocol implementation next, or sketch the event dispatcher that routes events to UI and plugins?

## Prompt:
Let's see the revised PRD and then a detailed plan of action with functional steps starting with tooling and setting the dev environment for the core. We'll address the plugin later, for now we'll make a fake plugin that simply echo to the console. Each step should be a self-contained unit, Github PR style with clear goals and review.

## Response:
Excellent — here's the **revised PRD** for **RedEye Core**, incorporating your goals for an extensible trigger system, minimal plugin setup (fake plugin for now), and developer-friendly iteration modeled on GitHub-style atomic PRs.

* * *

📝 RedEye Core – Product Requirements Document (v0.2)
-----------------------------------------------------

### 🧭 Purpose

RedEye is a macOS menu bar app that listens for contextual system events (starting with text selection) and dispatches them to modular, external plugins. It is open-source, non-commercial, and optimized for local installation and developer iteration.

* * *

### 🔧 MVP Scope (v0.1)

#### ✅ Core Features

1.  **Menu Bar App (Swift)**
    
    *   Lightweight app running in the macOS menu bar.
        
    *   Minimal preferences UI (or no UI at first).
        
    *   Logs actions and debug output to the console.
        
2.  **Trigger Framework**
    
    *   Modular architecture for capturing system/user events.
        
    *   First implemented trigger: `TextSelectionTrigger` using:
        
        *   Accessibility API to get selected text from focused app.
            
        *   CGEventTap or hotkey to detect trigger gesture (⌘⇧C).
            
3.  **Event System**
    
    *   Normalized `RedEyeEvent` type carrying context and metadata.
        
    *   Events passed to all active plugins.
        
4.  **Plugin Invocation System**
    
    *   Plugins discovered from a folder (e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/RedEye/Plugins`)
        
    *   Plugin = executable with simple stdin/stdout contract.
        
    *   First (fake) plugin: `echo` prints event info to console.
        
5.  **Floating UI (Basic)**
    
    *   Shows plugin buttons near mouse pointer when an event is triggered.
        
    *   Not required in first steps; stubbed if necessary.
        

* * *

### 🔒 Permissions

*   Accessibility Access (required for AX API).
    
*   Input Monitoring (optional, for gesture detection).
    
*   No App Store constraints.
    

* * *

### 🌿 Not in Scope (yet)

*   Real plugin actions (e.g., OpenAI API)
    
*   Presence detection, screen capture
    
*   Full preferences window
    
*   Plugin sandboxing
    

* * *

✅ Plan of Action: Atomic Dev Steps (PR Style)
---------------------------------------------

Each step is a clearly scoped unit, ideally producing something testable.

* * *

### **🔧 Step 1: Project Setup**

*   **Goal:** Create the RedEye Swift macOS app skeleton.
    
*   **Includes:**
    
    *   Xcode project with AppKit target (`RedEye`)
        
    *   NSStatusItem in menu bar with “Quit” option
        
    *   App launches and logs to console
        
*   **Deliverable:** RedEye.app builds and runs, visible in menu bar.
    
*   **Review:** App icon shown, logs "RedEye started".
    

* * *

### **👁️ Step 2: Text Selection Trigger**

*   **Goal:** Add `TextSelectionTrigger` to capture selected text in the active app.
    
*   **Includes:**
    
    *   Uses Accessibility API (`AXUIElement`) to read focused element
        
    *   Activated by keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧C)
        
*   **Deliverable:** On shortcut, log selected text or fallback notice.
    
*   **Review:** Console shows: `Selected text: "..."`
    

* * *

### **📦 Step 3: Event System (RedEyeEvent)**

*   **Goal:** Create unified `RedEyeEvent` type and emit from triggers.
    
*   **Includes:**
    
    *   `RedEyeEvent` struct with type, sourceApp, contextText
        
    *   Triggers call `TriggerManager.emit(event:)`
        
*   **Deliverable:** Events are logged in JSON format.
    
*   **Review:** Console shows well-formed event object.
    

* * *

### **🧱 Step 4: Plugin Manager (stub)**

*   **Goal:** Create `PluginManager` that loads and executes simple shell plugins.
    
*   **Includes:**
    
    *   Scans plugin directory
        
    *   Runs `echo` plugin with text from event
        
*   **Deliverable:** Fake plugin logs input text to console.
    
*   **Review:** Console shows plugin stdout: `You selected: "..."`
    

* * *

### **🎛️ Step 5: Popup UI (placeholder)**

*   **Goal:** Show a basic popup menu with plugin options near mouse pointer.
    
*   **Includes:**
    
    *   NSPanel or borderless NSWindow anchored to cursor
        
    *   Clicking menu item runs corresponding plugin
        
*   **Deliverable:** Menu shows, plugin runs.
    
*   **Review:** Visual confirmation + console output
    

* * *

### **📑 Step 6: Logging & Dev Mode**

*   **Goal:** Add structured logging for dev/test.
    
*   **Includes:**
    
    *   `RedEyeLog.info/debug/error(...)` wrapper
        
    *   Toggle verbosity with build flag or menu bar option
        
*   **Deliverable:** Logs show detailed trace of flow.
    
*   **Review:** Logs clean, color-coded if possible.
    

* * *

Would you like to begin with Step 1 (tooling + Xcode setup), or do you want the folder structure and starter code stubs now?

## Prompt:
IDE setup first. I usually works with VSCode/Cursor, but in this case Xcode is mandatory. But I'm now accustomed to pair programing with models like yourself. What options do I have?

## Response:
You're absolutely right — for building native macOS apps in Swift (especially with AppKit), **Xcode is mandatory** for:

*   Proper code signing & entitlements
    
*   Interface Builder (if needed)
    
*   macOS SDK access
    
*   Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions setup
    
*   Debugging with Console + Instruments
    

But since you're accustomed to **pair programming with models like me** in **VSCode** or **Cursor**, here's a breakdown of how you can combine **Xcode's build system** with your preferred dev workflow.

* * *

🧰 IDE & Workflow Options for RedEye (Swift macOS app)
------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ 1. **Primary: Xcode for Build/Run/Test**

*   Use Xcode for:
    
    *   Creating the project
        
    *   Setting up targets, signing, permissions
        
    *   Running and debugging the app
        
    *   Interface Builder (if needed)
        

🧩 But use it minimally — think of it like a compiler frontend.

* * *

### 🔁 2. **Edit in VSCode or Cursor**

*   Open the `.xcodeproj` folder in VSCode.
    
*   Use VSCode for:
    
    *   Editing `.swift` files (e.g., trigger classes, plugin manager)
        
    *   Viewing directory structure
        
    *   Pair programming with GPT (me)
        

🧠 I can help you write modular Swift files in VSCode, and you can immediately switch to Xcode to build/run.

* * *

### 🔧 Setup Steps

1.  **Create Xcode project**: `macOS > App > AppKit`
    
    *   Call it `RedEye`
        
    *   Disable SwiftUI, we’ll use AppKit
        
    *   Set `Team` (for signing)
        
    *   Set bundle ID (e.g., `dev.vic.redeye`)
        
2.  **Enable capabilities**:
    
    *   Enable **App Sandbox**
        
    *   Under "App Sandbox", enable:
        
        *   `Accessibility`
            
        *   `Files: Read/Write access` to plugins folder
            
        *   `Outgoing Connections` (for future plugin HTTP)
            
    *   Add `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` and `NSAccessibilityUsageDescription` to Info.plist
        
3.  **Open the project folder in VSCode**
    
    *   VSCode will show all source files
        
    *   Optionally use [Swift Language Server](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) for basic autocomplete
        
    *   Use Xcode for build/debug, but VSCode for editing and GPT interaction
        
4.  **Optional CLI tooling:**
    
    *   Install [Xcodes CLI](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/xcodes) to manage Xcode versions
        
    *   Use `xcodebuild` if you want to script builds/tests later
        

* * *

### 🧠 Suggested GPT Workflow

*   In VSCode: You write the description / class stub → I help you refine the logic and write code.
    
*   You copy/paste into Xcode to test.
    
*   For live UI tweaks or permission errors, I help you interpret logs.
    

* * *

Would you like a concrete step-by-step for creating the initial Xcode project (`Step 1`) next, or jump straight into creating the file layout and `AppDelegate` stub?

## Prompt:
I'm right now interacting with you using the Mac ChatGPT desktop app. This app can interact with other open apps (computer use) like Xcode. Wouldn't that be enough?

## Response:
Yes — that changes things significantly. Since you're using the **ChatGPT Mac app**, you're in one of the **best environments for model-assisted macOS development**. Here's what that enables and how you can leverage it:

* * *

🧠 Advantages of Using ChatGPT Mac App for RedEye Dev
-----------------------------------------------------

### ✅ 1. **System Integration**

*   The ChatGPT app can:
    
    *   Read file contents and folders you drop into the chat.
        
    *   Interact with currently open files (when dragged or copy-pasted).
        
    *   Help you edit code from Xcode or VSCode directly.
        

🔹 **You can drag in**:

*   `.swift` files
    
*   `.xcodeproj` folders
    
*   Screenshots of interface builders or errors
    
*   `Console.app` logs, crash reports
    

I can parse, analyze, and edit them with context.

* * *

### ✅ 2. **Live Pair Programming With Xcode**

*   You keep **Xcode open** for:
    
    *   Running the app
        
    *   Dealing with code signing, Info.plist, Interface Builder
        
*   You use **ChatGPT for everything else**:
    
    *   Writing classes, triggers, and events
        
    *   Understanding obscure Cocoa APIs
        
    *   Debugging permissions or plist issues
        
    *   Generating modular Swift code incrementally
        

📎 Copy from Xcode → Paste here → I refactor/fix → You paste back

* * *

### ✅ 3. **VSCode for Content Editing**

*   You can still use **VSCode/Cursor** for faster editing if desired
    
*   ChatGPT Mac app can co-pilot this if you drag in files or snippets
    
*   But since Swift build/debug is tied to Xcode, it’s fine to stay mostly in Xcode for RedEye
    

* * *

🛠 Suggested Setup
------------------

1.  Use **Xcode to create and run the project**
    
2.  Use **ChatGPT Mac app** as your live coding assistant:
    
    *   "Here’s my `AppDelegate.swift`, how can I add CGEventTap?"
        
    *   "Why is `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue` returning nil?"
        
    *   "Refactor this trigger into a class conforming to my protocol"
        
3.  Use **VSCode optionally** for editing with multi-pane UI, Git, markdown
    

* * *

### ✅ Yes — in short: **this ChatGPT app + Xcode = enough**.

You can treat this session like an embedded pair programmer inside your macOS dev environment.

#### Tasks

1.  **Create the Xcode Project**
    
    *   Open Xcode → **File > New > Project…**
        
    *   Select **macOS → App** (AppKit, not SwiftUI) → **Next**
        
    *   Product Name: `RedEye`
        
    *   Team: _Your Apple ID team_
        
    *   Organization Identifier: e.g. `dev.vic`
        
    *   Interface: **Storyboard** or **SwiftUI** (Storyboard is fine; UI is minimal)
        
    *   Language: **Swift**
        
    *   Click **Next**, choose your local folder, then **Create**
        
2.  **Configure Signing & Capabilities**
    
    *   Select the **RedEye** target → **Signing & Capabilities**
        
    *   Add **App Sandbox** capability
        
        *   Under App Sandbox, enable:
            
            *   **Accessibility** (for future AX API use)
                
            *   **File Access** → User Selected File (for plugins folder)
                
            *   **Outgoing Connections** (for later HTTP/API calls)
                
    *   In **Info.plist**, add keys:
        
        *   `Privacy - Accessibility Usage Description` → “RedEye needs accessibility access to detect text selections.”
            
        *   `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` → placeholder for future triggers
            
3.  **Implement Status Item & Logging**
    
    *   Open `AppDelegate.swift` (or create it if not already present)
        
    *   In `applicationDidFinishLaunching(_:)`, add:
        
        ```swift
        let item = NSStatusBar.system.statusItem(withLength: NSStatusItem.squareLength)
        item.button?.title = "👁"
        NSLog("RedEye started")
        ```
        
    *   Ensure the app’s “Main Interface” in the target is unset (so no unwanted windows appear).
        
4.  **Run & Verify**
    
    *   Build and Run (`⌘R`)
        
    *   **Verify**:
        
        *   A new “👁” icon shows in the menu bar
            
        *   Xcode’s console logs: `RedEye started`
            

* * *

Once you’ve got this working, let me know and we’ll move on to wiring up the first trigger.

## Prompt:
What about git, does Xcode handle it directly? I'd like to have the GitHub repo setup form the beginning?

## Response:
Xcode has first-class support for Git, so you can get your repo wired up from day one without ever leaving the IDE (though you can always drop to the command-line or use the GitHub CLI if you prefer). Here are two common workflows:

* * *

1\. In Xcode (GUI-only)
-----------------------

1.  **Create a local Git repo on project creation**  
    When you go to **File → New → Project…**, make sure **“Create Git repository on my Mac”** is checked before you click **Create**.
    
2.  **Add your GitHub account**
    
    *   Xcode → Preferences → Accounts
        
    *   Click **+**, choose **GitHub**, sign in (via token or OAuth).
        
    *   Now Xcode can talk to GitHub directly.
        
3.  **Create the remote GitHub repo**
    
    *   In the navigator, select your project root.
        
    *   From the menu: **Source Control → Create GitHub Repository…**
        
    *   Choose your organization/user, repo name, visibility, and click **Create**.
        
4.  **Push your initial commit**  
    Xcode will automatically add `origin` and push your local commits up.
    

* * *

2\. Using GitHub CLI + Xcode
----------------------------

If you like the terminal (and want scriptable control):

1.  **Initialize in Xcode** (step 1 above) or manually:
    
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/RedEye
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit – project skeleton"
    ```
    
2.  **Create on GitHub with GH CLI**:
    
    ```bash
    gh repo create vic/RedEye --public --source=. --push
    ```
    
3.  **Open in Xcode**:
    
    ```bash
    open RedEye.xcodeproj
    ```
    

Xcode will detect the existing Git repo and show all your branches/changes in the Source Control navigator.

* * *

.gitignore
----------

Make sure to include a Swift/Xcode‐appropriate `.gitignore`, e.g.:

```gitignore
# Xcode
DerivedData/
build/
*.xcworkspace
*.xcuserdata
*.moved-aside
*.pbxuser
# Swift Package Manager
/.build/
# CocoaPods
Pods/
# Carthage
Carthage/Build/
# fastlane
fastlane/report.xml
fastlane/Preview.html
```

* * *

**Next step:** once your repo is live, we can draft the initial directory layout (`Sources/`, `Plugins/`, etc.) and push that structure so every PR step starts from the same baseline. Let me know when you’re ready!

I don't see Accessibility in App SandBox

## Response:
Thought for 8 seconds

Accessibility access on macOS isn’t controlled under the App Sandbox entitlements— it’s a separate “TCC” permission that you grant in System Settings, not a sandbox toggle you flip in Xcode. In fact, **sandboxed apps cannot call the Accessibility API**, so if you need AXUIElement calls you must turn the sandbox off. Here’s what to do:

* * *

### 1\. Disable App Sandbox (for now)

1.  In your target’s **Signing & Capabilities**, remove the **App Sandbox** capability entirely.
    
2.  (You can keep Hardened Runtime enabled if you plan to notarize, but leave sandbox off.)
    

* * *

### 2\. Add Privacy Usage Description

Open your **Info.plist** and add:

```xml
<key>Privacy - Accessibility Usage Description</key>
<string>RedEye needs accessibility access to detect selected text.</string>
```

* * *

### 3\. Prompt for Accessibility

At runtime, before you make any AX calls, check whether you’ve been allowed:

```swift
import ApplicationServices

func requestAccessibilityPermission() {
    let opts = [kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt.takeUnretainedValue() as String: true] as CFDictionary
    let trusted = AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions(opts)
    NSLog("Accessibility permission granted? \(trusted)")
}
```

Call `requestAccessibilityPermission()` early (e.g. in `applicationDidFinishLaunching`). The system will pop up a dialog guiding the user to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** where they can check “RedEye”.

* * *

Once you’ve done that and granted permission, your AXUIElement‐based `TextSelectionTrigger` will start returning real selected‐text strings.

Let me know when you’ve got sandbox off and AX prompting, and we can wire up the first trigger!

## Prompt:
where is  Info.plist?

## Response:
You’ll find (or add) your **Info.plist** in your Xcode project’s file hierarchy. Here are two quick ways to locate it:

* * *

### 1\. Via Project Navigator

1.  In Xcode’s left sidebar, select the **Project Navigator** (⌘+1).
    
2.  Look for a group/folder named **“Supporting Files”**, **“Resources”**, or similar.
    
3.  You should see **Info.plist** listed there.
    
4.  If it’s not present, right-click on your app target folder → **New File…** → **Resource** → **Property List**, name it **Info.plist**, and add it to your target.
    

* * *

### 2\. Via Target Build Settings

1.  Click your project in the Project Navigator, then select the **RedEye** target.
    
2.  Go to **Build Settings** → search for **Info.plist File** under the **Packaging** section.
    
3.  The value there is the path to your Info.plist (relative to your project).
    
4.  Double-click that path to reveal/open the file in Xcode.
    

* * *

Once opened, you can add the **Privacy – Accessibility Usage Description** key (or any other plist key) directly in the editor.

## Prompt:
Don't know how to do this: "Ensure the app’s “Main Interface” in the target is unset (so no unwanted windows appear)."

## Response:
To prevent Xcode from automatically loading a storyboard or window at launch, you need to clear out the “Main Interface” setting in your app target. Here’s how:

* * *

### 1\. Open Your Target’s General Settings

1.  In Xcode’s left sidebar, click the blue **RedEye** project.
    
2.  In the center pane, under **PROJECT**, select **RedEye** (your app) and then switch to the **General** tab.
    

* * *

### 2\. Clear the Main Interface Field

1.  Scroll down to the **Deployment Info** section.
    
2.  You’ll see a field labeled **Main Interface**, normally populated with something like “Main” or the name of your storyboard.
    
3.  Click into that dropdown or text field and delete whatever is there so that it’s completely empty.
    

> **Result:** Xcode will no longer instantiate any storyboard or nib at launch, so you won’t get an unwanted window.

* * *

### 3\. (Optional) Remove Storyboard References

If you want to be extra sure:

*   **Info.plist cleanup**
    
    *   In **Build Settings**, locate **Info.plist File** to open your plist.
        
    *   Remove any keys like `NSMainNibFile` or `UIMainStoryboardFile` (these are iOS keys, but double-check you don’t have obsolete entries).
        

* * *

Now when you run RedEye, no windows will appear—just your menu-bar icon and console log. Let me know once you’ve cleared that out and we’ll wire up your first trigger!
